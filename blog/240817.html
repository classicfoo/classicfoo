		<h2>Moving away from blogger and starting again here</h2>
		<p>I am staring yet another blog. I've decided blogger is not the best place to put my blog posts anymore because at any moment without notice Google can simply decide to erase your stuff. Google has worked very hard to win the trust of customers, but you have to remember that they are not so innocent. They live to sell your data. That is their business. That is in their terms and conditions. And while most people agree to those terms, I don't think the vast majority of the public realize what freedoms they are actually giving away. You are basically letting Google own you. The consequences my arise when you least expect it.</p>
