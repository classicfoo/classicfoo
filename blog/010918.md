#The 'michael long' way
A term coined by your's truly. It's getting into the flow, it's doing things practically, intentionally, gracefully yet acknowledging by planning for human error. As vulcan's strive to live logically, a human can strive for the michael long way.

#solidifying thoughts
I've had so many great thoughts and ideas over the past couple of days, but I'm afraid that since I haven't written them down they'll be forgotten. This blog serves as a way to remember those thoughts and offer some important ideas that are worth meditating on. These thoughts are the seeds of future behaviour and can contribute much to the michael long way.
