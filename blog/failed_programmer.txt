Failed programmer

I have been trying to transistion to another career (in software development) for a while now. After taking a 2 week vacation and what was supposed to be a time to ultimately find a job in programming, I have come out empty handed. I really wanted it too. I went so far as to keep it a secret from coworkers and family. I found the goal of getting a programming job a really difficult task.

The role I'm currently in was only supposed to be temporary. First I was an ISR helper but now I'm a Sales Support Analyst. I feel like I may have outgrown the role and overstayed my welcome. All the other ISR helpers / rovers have long transistioned to the full ISR role, while I stay in this junior position. 

I've been here for about 2 years now. It feels like it has been an eternity. I know many of the ins and outs of the business. People new to the ISR and rover role now come to me for advice. Which I happily give my time to mentor. They look up to me and I smile, however, I die a little inside knowing that they are probably earning more than me, take less time to travel to work than me and now have a better head start than I did. Because I am mentoring them.

The reason why is quite complicated. I have been undecisive when it came to moving roles within Dell. I've told people that this career track wasn't for me. I'm stuck.
